# DBOrders
A simple web app with MVC and routing for IT course. It's based on the  [`classicmodels` sample database](http://www.mysqltutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mysqlsampledatabase.zip) and a few custom tables (scripts are provided).

For the model component, designed with ORM, I used my [ORM Templates](https://github.com/EPMatt/php-orm-templates).

## Installation
* Import the [`classicmodels` sample database](http://www.mysqltutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mysqlsampledatabase.zip);
* Run `province.sql`, `users.sql` and `actions.sql` SQL scripts on the `classicmodels` db;
* Edit the `config.ini` file with your settings for connecting to the DBMS.
